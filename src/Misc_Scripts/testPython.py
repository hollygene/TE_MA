#to comment in python use the # still like in bash scripting

# Sample Code:

x = 10; y = "Hello!" # this is a comment # use a semicolon ; to separate statements on the same line
z = 3.14            # z is a floating number

    # assignment uses =; comparison uses ==
if z == 3.14 or y == "Hello!": # logical operators are words: and, or, not
    x = x + 1       # must use consistent indentation within a block (4 spaces)
    y = y + "Python!"  # for numbers: + - * / % are as expected; for strings, + means concatenation

print x # basic printing statement is print
print y
